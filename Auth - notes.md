Auth
Authentication: Proving you are who you say you are
Authorization: Demonstrating you have access to \_\_\_

When you login, you are authenticating, after logging in successfully either a
session cookie (server) or JWT token (client) is created to prove you've done this.
Using this, a server can determine if you are AUTHORIZED to see any particular page.
